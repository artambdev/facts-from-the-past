## Overview

Facts From the Past is an interactive website that aims to teach fun facts about history in an appealing way. Visitors are given a ten-question quiz on a variety of topics with a choice of four answers to pick from. Correct or incorrect, they are also offered tidbits of explanation behind the event or fact in question. Encouraging messages accompany their progress. The quiz can be replayed, with questions and answers shuffled into a new order to keep the player on their toes.

## Design
A few wireframes were made in advance of starting development to plan out the most important features and the structure of code that would be required to accompany them.

The wireframes are presented below:

### Colour
- A pleasant pattern of light lilac with pink highlights is meant to evoke a kind feeling to the quiz rather than a stressful one, a fun game rather than a test. Answer buttons are given different colours to distinguish them, with popups using gold colouration to indicate forwards progress.

### Font
- Headings use the Noto Sans font while other text uses the Lato font. Both are popular sans-serif fonts that are easy to read and suitable for viewing on screens. In case of a failure to load, they both default to the browser's default sans-serif font.
